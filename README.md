## Workflow Overview

Hereâ€™s a basic workflow design:

![Workflow Diagram](image/workflow.png)

Based on the user message, the router determines one of four options:

- **`rag`**: For extracting details from the NVIDIA 2024 Annual Report.  
- **`price`**: For fetching only the stock price.  
- **`both`**: For retrieving both report details and stock price.  
- **`chit_chat`**: For casual, off-topic conversations.

### Functionality Breakdown

1. **RAG Runner**: Adds context from the NVIDIA document to the user query before passing it to the LLM.  
2. **Stock Price Fetcher**: Provides real-time stock prices using custom functions.  used https://finazon.io/ for api

- For `rag` and `both` paths, RAG context is included in the query.  
- For `chit_chat`, no additional functions or context are used.  
- For `price`, only the stock price function is invoked without RAG context.
